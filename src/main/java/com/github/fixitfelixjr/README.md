# 🔨 Fix-It Felix Jr. Game Project

## 🧾 Overview
This project is an implementation of the "Fix-It Felix Jr." game, as seen in the Disney Pixar film "Wreck-It Ralph". The game is being developed using the YAEGER (Yet Another Engine for Game Engineering Research) game engine, as part of the Software Engineering Basics - Object-Oriented Programming course. Our goal is to recreate the classic gameplay experience, where players control Fix-It Felix to repair the damage caused by Wreck-It Ralph, while navigating through multiple levels of increasing difficulty.

## 🎮 Gameplay
Players take on the role of Fix-It Felix, using his magical hammer to repair windows damaged by Wreck-It Ralph. The game is structured into levels, each containing several stages that represent different parts of the apartment building. Players start with three lives and must avoid being hit by bricks thrown by Ralph. Occasionally, a Nicelander will place a pie on a windowsill, serving as a power-up that temporarily makes Felix invincible and able to fix windows with a single hit.

## 🪂 Features
- **Player Character (Fix-It Felix):** Controlled by the player, with the ability to move horizontally and vertically across the screen to repair windows.
- **Enemy (Wreck-It Ralph):** The antagonist who randomly moves at the top of the screen and throws bricks to damage the windows.
- **Power-Ups:** Cakes that provide temporary invincibility, an extra life or enhanced repair speed.
- **NPCs (Nicelanders):** Characters that occasionally provide power-ups to the player.
- **Scoring System:** Points are awarded for repairing windows, collecting pies, and completing stages.

## 👨‍💻 Development
The game is developed using the YAEGER game engine, adhering to object-oriented programming standards. The codebase focuses on modularity, readability, and efficient game mechanics.
